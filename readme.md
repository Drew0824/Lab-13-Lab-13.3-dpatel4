# Multiplying numbers in a loop

Write a loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be multiplied and the product displayed. The loop should ask the user if they wish to perform the operation again. If so, the loop should repeat, otherwise it should terminate.

*Sample output:*

Enter first number: **3**
Enter second number: **5**
The product is 15
Multiply more numbers? (y/n): **y**
Enter first number: **4**
Enter second number: **6**
The product is 24
Multiply more numbers? (y/n): **n**
Goodbye.
